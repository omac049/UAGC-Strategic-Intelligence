## Daily Reminders
- **Documentation Quality:** Every MD document should follow Diátaxis framework (tutorials, how-to guides, reference, explanation)
- **User-Centered Focus:** Write for developers, implementers, and maintainers - not just readers
- **Consistency Check:** Ensure all cross-references between sections remain accurate
- **No Mock Data:** Focus on troubleshooting and enhancing existing files, not creating mock content

---

## Landing
*Quick capture for new tasks and ideas - organize later*

- Review existing implementation guides for gaps
- Check for any missing cross-references in current docs
- Identify reusable code snippets from HTML for technical docs
