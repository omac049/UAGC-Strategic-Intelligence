### Enrollment Seasonality Analysis
```yaml
Peak Performance Periods:
  Fall Enrollment: August-October (highest RFI volume)
  Spring Enrollment: January-March (secondary peak)
  Summer Sessions: May-July (lower volume, higher conversion)
  
Weekly Patterns:
  Highest Performance: Tuesday-Thursday
  Weekend Performance: 23% lower conversion rates
  Mobile Peak: 6-9 PM weekdays
```

## Recommendations for Improvement

### Priority 1: UTM Parameter Optimization
- Implement enhanced UTM parameter capture (78% → 92% target)
- Standardize partner tracking implementation
- Cross-device attribution enhancement

### Priority 2: Channel-Specific Optimization
