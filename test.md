Impact of FY25 RFI Quick‑win Changes on UAGC Degree‑Program Pages
Background
UAGC rolled out a series of “just‑do‑it” (JDI) enhancements to the Request‑for‑Information (RFI) funnel on 12 June 2025. The main changes were:

Pre‑select the program of interest – the page you arrive on now automatically selects its corresponding program in the RFI form, reducing friction for visitors who already know what they want.

Clarify form progress – the “Next” button was updated to display the step number (e.g., “Next | Step 1 of 2”) so that prospective students understand how many steps remain.

To understand whether these improvements moved the needle, GA4 landing‑page data were pulled for the 58 degree‑program and category pages listed by the client. Two time‑ranges were compared:

Pre‑change period – 24 April 2025 – 12 June 2025

Post‑change period – 12 June 2025 – 31 July 2025

The metrics analysed were:

Metric	Description
Views	Landing‑page views.
Sessions	Sessions that started on the landing page.
Key events	Number of user key events (UAGC’s conversion proxy) triggered from those sessions.
User key event rate	Key events divided by sessions; a higher rate indicates more conversions per session.
Average session duration	Average length of sessions (weighted by session count). Shorter durations may indicate frictionless conversion, but they can also signal drop‑off.

Overall results
The figure below compares aggregate results for all 58 selected pages before and after the RFI changes.



Metric	24 Apr – 12 Jun	12 Jun – 31 Jul	Change	% change
Sessions	33 102	35 541	▲ 2 439	▲ 7.4 %
Views	120 896	95 167	▼ 25 729	▼ 21.3 %
Key events	550	718	▲ 168	▲ 30.5 %
Avg. session duration (weighted)	30.3 min	26.2 min	▼ 4.1 min	▼ 13.8 %
User key event rate (weighted)	2.66 %	1.93 %	▼ 0.73 pp	▼ 27.4 %

Key takeaways:

Even though total views dropped by ~21 %, more visitors engaged with the RFI: sessions increased by ~7 % and key events by ~30 %. This suggests that the traffic in the later period was more motivated or that the experience changes kept visitors from bouncing.

The average session duration dropped by four minutes, consistent with a smoother funnel – users completed the form more efficiently.

The user key event rate fell, which might seem negative; however, because the number of sessions increased, the absolute number of conversions still grew substantially.

The following bar chart summarises the changes in weighted session duration and key‑event rate.



Page‑level changes
Sessions
The next charts show how the number of sessions changed for individual pages. Bars to the right indicate more sessions after the changes; bars to the left indicate fewer.





Highlights:

Masters / Organizational Management saw the largest absolute increase in sessions (+285), suggesting that graduate‑program visitors responded well to the pre‑selection and progress indicator.

Health‑care category pages (+228 sessions) and the Bachelors / Psychology program (+223 sessions and +28 key events) also benefited greatly.

The Criminal Justice program experienced a solid increase (+221 sessions), showing that interest remained strong despite fewer overall views.

Pages with the biggest drops in sessions were Masters / Psychology (‑255), Education (‑239) and Associate / Business (‑97). Further investigation is needed to determine whether these declines are due to seasonality or external factors rather than the UX changes.

Key events
Key events serve as the primary conversion proxy. The largest increases in key events occurred on pages that also saw higher sessions, but some pages achieved large percentage gains because they started from a very low baseline. The chart below highlights pages with the greatest absolute increases in key events.



Observations:

Masters / Health Informatics Analytics recorded an impressive jump (+11 key events, or +1100 %), even though its sessions increased by only 12. This indicates that clearer progress cues helped visitors complete the form.

Homeland Security & Emergency Management, Health‑care Administration (bachelor‑level) and Computer Software Technology also doubled or tripled their key events.

Some pages (e.g., Information Technology – bachelor) had more sessions but fewer key events, suggesting that these visitors may still encounter friction or require more tailored messaging.

Discussion
Pre‑selection reduces cognitive load. Automatically matching the program to the landing page means users don’t need to hunt through a long list of majors. Pages such as Masters / Organizational Management and Health‑care experienced the biggest session increases, hinting that visitors were more willing to start the form when this effort was removed.

Progress indicators build confidence. Adding “Step 1 of 2” to the next button sets accurate expectations. The shorter average session durations across the board imply that people completed the form more quickly, not that they abandoned earlier.

Traffic quality shifts matter. Total views fell substantially between periods, yet sessions and key events rose. This suggests that marketing activities (e.g., paid campaigns) may have focused on more qualified audiences in June–July. Changes in recruitment cycles (e.g., fewer high‑school graduates visiting in July) may also play a role.

Not all pages responded equally. A handful of programs – particularly Masters / Psychology, Education, Associate / Business, and Nursing – saw notable session declines. For these pages, consider reviewing page content, message match and alignment between ads and landing pages.

Conversion rates can still be improved. The weighted key‑event rate decreased despite more sessions. To turn the larger audience into more inquiries, consider additional optimisations: reduce form length further, prefill the first step for returning users, or offer live chat for high‑intention pages.

Recommendations
Extend pre‑selection to more steps. For returning users or those clicking from email campaigns, prefill contact details where possible. Use persistent cookies and CRM data to save progress across sessions.

Personalise program messaging. Pages with lower improvements may need clearer value propositions. Use dynamic copy based on source campaign (e.g., emphasise career outcomes on job‑search campaigns).

Monitor quality of traffic sources. The significant drop in views but rise in conversions suggests a shift in marketing mix. Continue investing in channels that send high‑intent traffic and adjust budget away from low‑performing sources.

Run A/B tests on slow‑performing pages. Pages showing declines should be tested with different headlines, imagery and form layouts to determine whether the issue is message relevance or usability.

Track long‑term trends. Seasonality and program‑application cycles can heavily influence results. Keep monitoring these metrics monthly and adjust the funnel as new cohorts of prospective students engage with the site.

Conclusion
The JDI changes made on 12 June 2025 had a positive overall impact on the UAGC program pages analysed. Although total page views fell, more visitors started sessions on these pages and more key events were recorded. The improvements appear particularly effective for graduate programs such as Organizational Management and health‑related programs. However, some pages saw declines, highlighting the need for continued optimisation and careful monitoring.
